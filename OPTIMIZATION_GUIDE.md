## üöÄ Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Add Enhanced CSS
Add this line to all your HTML pages after your existing CSS:

```

### Step 2: Add Email Pop-up to Pages
Add the following before the closing `</body>` tag on all strategy pages:

```html
<!-- Copy the entire content from email-popup.html -->
<!-- Then add the JavaScript -->
<script src="email-popup.js"></script>
```

### Step 3: Update Existing Pages
Replace your current strategies.html with strategies-optimized.html or merge the improvements.

### Step 4: Update Individual Strategy Pages
For each strategy page (gap-and-go, gap-and-close, monthly-dip), apply these changes:

1. **Simplify the hero section** - Keep only key metrics
2. **Break content into digestible sections** with clear headings
